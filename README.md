# Resume project

To display my front-end skills, I decided to create an interactive resume.

## Objectives

- [ ] The website **uses only HTML & CSS**.
- [ ] Its a modern world, full of mobile devices, so it should be
      **mobile-friendly**.
- [ ] I care, so it should be **accessible**.
- [ ] It should work smoothly and be **performant**.
- [ ] It should **display well in the latest versions on popular browser**,
      with different CSS and HTML engines _(Gecko, Webkit, etc.)_.
- [ ] It should be **honest**.
